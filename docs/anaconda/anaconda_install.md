# Install Anaconda

Anaconda is a great tool for python environments.

## Windows
### Installer
Anaconda installers can be found [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). **Beware of the path of which Anaconda is installed on**.

### Windows Path
Open environmental variables, then go into Path, after that add a new path and insert the path of **Anaconda Path**/Scripts. To verify that the conda is added to path, run the following command in a new terminal (restart existing terminals for windows variables to update):
> conda 

### Uninstall
Uninstallation is done by the installer or windows control panel for uninstallation of programs. Although it many files may be left after uninstallation where conda was installed and may need to be removed manually.
